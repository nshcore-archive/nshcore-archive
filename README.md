### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This account is a place where I can archive all my old projects from https://github.com/nshcore 

I'm so OCD about well structured code even my repos need to be cleaned ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

All projects were either:

* Something I was testing out and abandoned.
* Wrote in a language I now abandoned.
* Became old and inferior to other better maintained projects out there.


Rather than just deleting them I keep them here. You never know when you might want to back reference something you did before.
